Checking by Postman^

1. get recommendations by userId:
    GET     http://localhost:8085/api/v1/recommendations/1

    We get data:
        [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "userId": "1",
                "productId": "680e7fd8b23942007cdada4d",
                "score": 0.5,
                "action": "VIEWED_PRODUCT"
            }
            ...
        ]

Here we get data with score = 0.5 = viewed some product (but not buy) and next time we can show to client
    recommendations about products witch client viewed (as list of things)
